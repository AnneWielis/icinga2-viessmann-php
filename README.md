# Viessmann Plugins for icinga2 / nagios / check_mk

This is a quick and dirty collection of my scripts is use for querying viessmann heating systems. Partly from nameless sources around the net - would be happpy to know the credits.

Consists of a Bash Script to be called via cron (all the stuff in this folder should reside in /opt/viessmann) and a plugin that should reside in the normal plugins directory.
